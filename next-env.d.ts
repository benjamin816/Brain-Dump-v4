// The triple-slash directives for Next.js types were removed from this file.
// They were causing errors, likely due to an environment where the Next.js 
// TypeScript plugin may not be active. Next.js types should be picked up 
// automatically from the tsconfig.json configuration in a standard setup.

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
